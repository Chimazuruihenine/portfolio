At the end of every election, a winner emerges, followed by debates on how uneducated the other half of the population is. At the end, everyone who engages in this conversation is as enlightened as they think they are. Democracy although defined as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Simply means everyone gets to have a say. Although we fail to accept this, we're not all equal, but this doesn't mean anyone is less.

If anyone has gone through life, they should have come to a realization at a later stage of their life that humans, although similar, are different, and for this very reason, people can do the same things or different things, and still get different results, or sometimes the same result. This is evident in schools, the workplace, and wherever one finds themselves.

The joke now is that the individuals who argue the rest of the world is uneducated, hence the reason for their bad /uninformed decisions, fail to realize that if this were the case, then the rest of the world needs educating. As they needed education to have learned (which is clearly not the case, as they're quite unaware of the circumstances), the world also needs to be educated, and this can't happen overnight, especially not in the year before an election.

If the educated ones can't learn overnight, how is it possible for the uneducated to learn in a year before these elections? This ignorance is a result of overlooking or not spotting the tiniest of details, which eventually come to haunt them. Most don't pay attention to details, and the few who do fail to pay attention to the little details, which, if left unchecked, come to haunt you without your awareness of being prey.

The world, or those who think they know, must come to realize that they're not the only ones who know. Genius exists both in light and darkness. And although both could make a solid argument on which side is light/right, this is irrelevant in their grand scheme. You're not the only one capable; if you were, you wouldn't have an opposition you're competing against.

Without even realizing it, when we downplay the capabilities of others, we downplay ours, as we've failed to make a proper assessment of another. And worse, how can someone we deem less capable be outcompeting us and having better results than we are? There's no excuse for the enlightened getting outsmarted by those they claim to be less enlightened, or worse, not enlightened. But then, are those who claim to be knowledgeable as knowledgeable about what they claim to know, and beyond?
