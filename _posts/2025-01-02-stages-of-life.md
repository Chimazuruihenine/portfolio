There are stages in life. Live right, but live life. Don't listen to people telling you they would do/ engage in a particular activity if they were 18 again, or things they wish they knew.

You have to do the little nothings, the meaningless, make mistakes, and have regrets. Then you learn and grow from it. If you don't, you see yourself doing them later on in life when the stakes are higher. All in all, live, learn, and grow.
