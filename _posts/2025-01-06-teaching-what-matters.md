We teach kids how to excel in their academics and improve their problem-solving skills, but forget to enlighten them on the most important things. Everything in life involves reasoning, and life is filled with conflicts that we must resolve.

We should teach kids how to tackle real-life problems like avoiding and resolving conflict, personal finance, understanding and seeing through people and situations.

Excelling in one's academics is important, but there are even more important things to learn that improve and protect us from the cruel nature of the world. Most people don't pay attention to detail, and the few who do always miss the most important.
