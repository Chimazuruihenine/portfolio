Do you think life gets better in the future? If you can't improve your circumstances now and make life better for yourself, chances are that in the future, things will get worse. Each day comes with a challenge, and if you can't face and overcome the challenges of today, they pile up, and when tomorrow comes, it arrives with a new challenge- add tomorrow's challenge to your unresolved problems of Yesterday, and you're worse off.

The moment we're born, we are expected to grow/ reach our potential and capabilities, while simultaneously going from 99 to 0. As each day we live, we're headed for the end. And to live life is to confront difficulties in a new day.

Do not worry about the tribulations of tomorrow. Face what life throws at you today and prepare for what's to come tomorrow. Face your problems one at a time. You first figure out how to make ends meet, how to increase your resources, and then how to protect yourself and those around you while maximizing your resources.

You don't go about protecting the resources you're in no possession of, nor can you protect those around you when you don't possess the attributes needed to. This is exactly why doing the right thing isn't sufficient, you must do the right thing at the right time.
