There's no such thing as courage; there's just a will and motivation to do or not do something. Courage is not embracing fear, confronting it, or the absence of fear; courage is simply acting on one's will on something. Courage is neither acting on the absence or presence of fear, but acting on choice. You get to be afraid when there's no choice or when the outcome of what you're fearful of outweighs the outcome of that which you aren't fearful of.

Deep within us, we make these choices even without consciously realizing it. Courage is simply weighing the outcome of a thing. We've heard of people overcoming their fear of something/ anything by being courageous and confronting such fear. But what we don't realize, or hear of, is that at the point in which they overcame/ confronted their fear, a choice was made. A choice between facing the outcome of the decision/ situation they find themselves in, and the outcome of their fear if they confront/ neglect it.
