The everyday person accepts and goes along with just about anything. Whatever the everyday person accepts, they can also reject depending on the circumstances. If you ever want to change the world's view on anything, convince the outliers and then make the change.

Don't bother convincing the everyday person, they always fall in line and go along with whatever is at hand, and barely ever question anything, much less what's right or wrong.
