Do you need an external motivation like luxury, fame, or riches to be successful? Do life circumstances not give you enough reason to desire success? Have you lived without possessing the basic things of life? Have you observed yourself going through the same obstacles your parents and their parents before them went through? Do you also want your descendants and those after them to face the same obstacles?

Life has given you every reason to want better for yourself and those around you, your motivation should be your circumstances. You should strive for yourself(you are reason enough), those around you, and those that are yet to be born. This is all the motivation one needs to live life.
