The little wins are very important because they help us believe. We get to believe that there would be light at the end of the tunnel, that our work would eventually yield positive outcomes. We get to believe in the possibilities of the impossible.

For the aspiring, newcomers, and the underdogs, striving and getting a little win is a start to greater wins. Be patient and keep striving.
