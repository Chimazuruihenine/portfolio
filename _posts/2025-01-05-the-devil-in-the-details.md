The first requirement in taking and giving good counsel is the devil in the details. This is the exact reason it's a waste of time reading books on how to succeed. People want detailed counsel for everything, and life doesn't work like that.

Ask yourself, if this is the blueprint for success, then how did people succeed before the establishment of this blueprint? If you think they had it tougher and the blueprint gives you an easy path, then you haven't realized that success is a journey, not a destination.

If you also think a blueprint helps in knowing and showing what needs to be done for success, then you're in a state of bliss(ignorance). If you have any chance at succeeding in life, then you naturally should have observed, realized, and possess the attributes needed for success.

In regards to what makes a counsel worth considering, you need to act more is an advice that should only be given to those who act less and think things through a lot. You need to often think things through is counsel that should only be given to those who rush into things. The devil is in the details.
