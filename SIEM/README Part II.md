# SECT: A Vision for Democratized Security

To the esteemed reader, this is an informal letter to you. Please pardon the familiarity in this read. Also, if all this seems too boring, you can just glance through and pay a little more attention to the call to action section.

## **Simply Put, What SECT Is**

SECT is not just for small businesses - it's for everyone. SECT is for the everyday person. Since nothing is 100 percent certain, at least from this perspective, it's certain that 99 percent of people who use their phones or computers and know how to open their emails can definitely use SECT. It's that simple. They can upload plain text, pictures/screenshots, and audio.

## **When Privacy Meets Reality**

The initial approach considered using normal LLM APIs, but that would not only cost more but defeat the privacy purpose. With an LLM fine-tuned and SECT using its API like it uses other APIs such as OCR, this would be feasible. Individuals have been successfully fine-tuning models they use locally. Also, this would be better than normal LLM APIs as it would be more security-focused and trained.

The version of SECT envisioned as truly enterprise-grade involves taking an open-source LLM and fine-tuning it into a security intelligence. Since they're free, the only cost would be hosting on a cloud platform. Or better still, use the DeepSeek approach and host it on a local computer with sufficient storage, with backups in different locations like a school. A college wouldn't mind housing this when it only costs them space and minimal electricity. After hosting on a cloud platform and inputting its API into SECT, the analysis would improve significantly. Since it's privacy first, SECT searches this database like a user asking ChatGPT for info, but SECT won't have prompt memory after giving results. Its only memory is its knowledge database.

## **Where Machines Meet Humans**

Also thinking of having vetted knowledgeable individuals participate. When the fine-tuned LLM isn't too sure, these individuals connect with users for a chat where they can share their email if they want and get feedback. Most social engineering scams aren't sophisticated but are sophisticated in the sense that for the individuals they're intended for, they get the job done. Someone might not fall for a romance scam, but someone desperate for affection might, and so on.

## **Students, Professors, and Everyone Else**

The student individuals don't need to be experts. As mentioned, these attacks are targeted and wouldn't need much nuance to notice by someone who isn't the intended target. Students can be lazy and sometimes unwilling to volunteer. But with partnerships with colleges, two problems could be solved. SECT gets its not-so-sophisticated experts, and institutions/professors claiming students no longer do assignments and hand everything to AI, that there's no longer critical thinking with students as AI does all, can readjust their class schedules to have lab work take more grade weight. Students will have assignments they can't hand to AI - consulting when queried by SECT. If their assessment and resolution for the user are great, the user can grade their assistance, translating to grades. The students also get real-life experience. So everyone wins.

## **Beginning With What We Have**

After much consideration, starting with a small parameter seems ideal, as this would easily enable fine-tuning locally on a personal computer. If all goes well, this would be the first LLM model for SECT.

## **Dreams, Reality, and Everything Between**

When I was young, I said I wanted to make a positive impact on society. This is amusing, but SECT might be a step to achieving this grandiose. SECT is not just for small businesses, it's for everyone... the everyday person.

Side note: To be honest, I won't say I had all of this in mind earlier. This vision wasn't fully formed and only improved while interacting with an LLM about a topic unrelated to this. Initially, using LLM APIs was the plan, but I already figured that would go against privacy. Just thought of fine-tuning open-source LLMs and the vetted student approach for human services while having a conversation with an LLM.

## **What You Can Do About It (A Call to Action)**

Readers are truly welcome and encouraged to take the initiative in making this a reality. It doesn't have to be a collaboration with any specific person - you could do this by yourself or with colleagues and friends. Other than the clich√© of contributing to humanity, you've now contributed to building a next-generation security tool/platform. Although SECT is free, you could commercialize the knowledge/skills gained from fine-tuning an LLM or building SECT. Or maybe you're already an expert, then this is just another fun project. For non-technical individuals who can't code - which is quite a contradiction but we'll let it slide, as you are likely reading this on GitHub, and using this platform means you are technical enough; maybe not just with the skills of fine-tuning or architecting software, but technical enough to understand the nuance, and that is truly fine - you can suggest this new model of students taking part to colleges/professors. Start little - it doesn't have to be a whole institution. Just a class, a student or two. You don't have to start big.
